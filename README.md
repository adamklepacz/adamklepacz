Hi, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript developer with great skills and experience in React, Next, Typescript, Node, Redux, and the Javascript ecosystem. I'm passionate about productivity and automation. If something is worth automating, I want to automate it. That way, I can focus on the tasks that really move projects forward and make a difference for our clients and myself.

I'm also interested in AI technology. That's why I'm so intrigued by OpenAI, Codex, GPT, and other tools. As software engineers, we have the opportunity to use AI to become more productive and focus on the things that matter, rather than spending time on repetitive, tedious tasks. To that end, I use tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Reverso Context, Deeply, Keyboard Maestro, Apple Shortcuts, Raycast, and others, on a daily basis.

I'm a hardware enthusiast too. I spend way too much money on tech gadgets like computers, smartphones, smartwatches, monitors, keyboards, mices, standing desks, etc.

Most recently, I've been working on a side hustleâ€”a reversed job board for React developers. You can follow my journey on LinkedIn!
